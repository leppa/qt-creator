    \title Connecting QNX Devices

    You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and debug
    applications on them from within \QC.

    \section1 Setting Up Connectivity on Playbook

    In order to deploy applications to the Playbook, you will need to enable
    Development Mode on the device and upload a debug token to it.

    Enabling Development Mode is done by sliding top-down on the Playbook,
    thereby opening the \uicontrol{Preferences}. Now go to \uicontrol{Security >
    Development Mode} and set \uicontrol{Use Development Mode} to \uicontrol{ON}. Enter the
    device password when asked to do so.

    \section2 USB Access

    The \uicontrol{Development Address} shown in the \uicontrol{Development Mode} settings
    is the IP address to use when you are connecting the device with a USB
    cable to the development PC. If you are deploying over a Wi-Fi network, you
    should use the IP address shown in \uicontrol{Preferences > About > Network}.

    To enable access over USB, change \uicontrol{Preferences > Storage & Sharing >
    USB Connections} to \uicontrol{Connect to Windows} if you are deploying from
    Windows, or \uicontrol{Connect to Mac} if you are deploying from Linux or OS X.

    \section2 Debug Token

    If you are using a physical device, you will have to upload a debug token to
    the device. The simulator does not require any debug token.

    \section3 Create a Debug Token

    You can create the debug token either in QNX Momentics or from the command
    line. There is currently no support for creating the debug token from
    within \QC.

    From the command line:
    \c{blackberry-debugtokenrequest -storepass <pass> -devicepin <your PB pin> debugtoken.bar}

    \section3 Install Debug Token on Playbook

    You can install the debug token on the Playbook either in QNX Momentics or
    from the command line. There is currently no support for installing the
    debug token from within \QC.

    From the command line:
    \c{blackberry-nativepackage -installDebugToken ~/.rim/debugtoken.bar -device <device_ip> [-password <device_pass>]}

    \section1 Adding a BlackBerry Device in \QC

    Adding a BlackBerry device is done using a wizard in the \uicontrol{Device
    Configurations} options. To launch it, go to \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
    \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol Add > \uicontrol {BlackBerry Device} > \uicontrol {Start Wizard}.

    \image qtcreator-qnx-device-configurations-wizard-1.png "Connection details"

    \list
        \li  In the \uicontrol{The name to identify this configuration} field, enter a
        name for the device.
        \li  In the \uicontrol{The device's host name or IP address} field, enter the
        host name or IP address of the device.
        \li  In the \uicontrol{Device password} field, enter the password for the device.
        \li  In the \uicontrol{Device type} field, select whether it is a \uicontrol{Physical
        device} or a \uicontrol{Simulator} you are connecting to.
        \li  In the \uicontrol{Debug token} field, enter the path to the debug token
        that is also installed on the device. This is only necessary if you are
        connecting to a \uicontrol{Physical device}.
        \li  Click \uicontrol{Next} to continue.
    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-qnx-device-configurations-wizard-2.png "SSH Key Setup"

    For the \uicontrol{SSH Key Setup}, you can either select an existing \b{4096}-bit
    key, or click \uicontrol{Generate} to create a new key. The generated key will be
    stored next to the \QC settings, in a \b{qnx} sub-directory.

    Click \uicontrol{Next} and then \uicontrol{Finish} to complete setting up the device
    connection.

    Once the device is added, you can edit the settings directly in \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Options > \uicontrol Devices.

    \section1 Adding a QNX Neutrino Device in \QC

    Adding a QNX Neutrino device is very similar to \l{Connecting Embedded
    Linux Devices}, except you need to select \uicontrol {QNX Device} in the
    \uicontrol {Device Configuration} wizard.
